                     Covid Data Analysis Project
This is the first project I have started my data analysis projects with.
In this project, I have taken the data from the website ourworldindata.com.
I initially imported the data into excel to gain a quick overview of data, i.e., rows and columns.
Then I imported the data into MS SQL Server, where I started to query the data with some basic queries so that I may get some information from the data.
Since the data is related to the covid scenario, I chose to analyze the data based on columns like Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, new_vaccinations, and Population.
Initially, some null values were also there, but the Covid started to spread late in some countries, so it was no use to delete those values.
Now I started the exploration process.
1.	Total Cases vs. Total Deaths
2.	Total Cases vs. Population
3.	Countries with Highest Infection Rate compared to Population
4.	Countries with Highest Death Count per Population
5.	Showing continents with the highest death count per Population.
6.	Total Population vs. Vaccinations.

After exploration of data in SQL, I extracted some tables from the data and imported the data into Tableau for further Visualization and created an insight of it.
